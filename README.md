# Welcome to Tweeter!

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This app was created as part of Lighthouse Labs' Web Development boot camp, and is a demonstration of the learning I have done in jQuery, HTML5, and CSS3. 

The application allows the user to 'tweet' from a textbox with a hard limit of 140 characters. The tweet will then render on the same page via an AJAX request, removing the need for a page refresh, posted by a randomly-generated user. The app demonstrates simple jQuery- and CSS-based animations, as well as site layout changes on differently-sized devices.

Thank you for looking, and I can't wait to get started on my next big app!
